# Staking contracts

## Overview

Merkl enables tracking and rewarding liquidity deposited in staking or restaking contractsâ€”even if these contracts do not issue receipt tokens to LPs.

Below are the custom campaign types currently supported. If you need support for a different contract type, please contact us.

### **Staking and Restaking**

- **Symbiotic Vault**
  Merkl can track Symbiotic Vaults, specifically monitoring the value of the underlying tokens deposited by users. This enables highly customizable reward campaigns, such as fixed or variable reward rates over time, points systems, or token distributions.

- **Masterchef Vault**
  Merkl supports tracking and rewarding liquidity in the most common Masterchef implementations.

### **Locker**

Locking is a core primitive in DeFi. Merkl can reward liquidity in locker contracts, allowing you to incentivize your most loyal users. Campaign creators can define custom reward curves or boosts, for example, based on the number of months a user locks their position.

- **Puffer : Carrot Locker**
