# Technical Overview

Merkl operates through an offchain engine that analyzes both onchain and offchain data to track user activity and allocate rewards based on campaign rules set by campaign creators. The Merkl engine processes reward data into a merkle tree, compresses it into a merkle root, and pushes it onchain, enabling users to claim rewards transparently and efficiently.

## üó∫Ô∏è Platform Overview

Merkl operates through campaigns created by campaign creators. A campaign is a time-bound incentive program where Merkl tracks onchain and offchain activity based on predefined rules. Rewards or points are either posted onchain or updated offchain via Merkl‚Äôs endpoints, allowing users to monitor their accumulated rewards.

### How it works

1. **Campaign Creation**: Campaign creators set up campaigns using a smart contract called the **Merkl Distribution Creator**. This includes defining eligibility criteria, reward structures, and distribution methods. Campaign details are then pushed onchain, along with the incentive tokens that need to be distributed
2. **User Participation**: Users engage with the protocol (e.g., providing liquidity, lending, borrowing) in order to earn the rewards/points as specified in the campaign.
3. **Reward Computation:** At fixed intervals, a system called the **Merkl Engine** fetches campaigns from the **Merkl Distribution Creator** contract and processes reward calculations based on available onchain and offchain data and on the rules set by the campaign creator. After this step, users can see that they have earned rewards which are only pending as they cannot claim them yet (awaiting reward update).
4. **Reward Update:** At regular intervals as well (potentially different from the reward computation intervals), the Merkl Engine generates a merkle tree from processed campaigns. This tree is then compressed as a merkle root that is pushed onchain to a contract called the **Merkl Distributor** contract. A reward file is also made available [here](https://app.merkl.xyz/status), in order to ensure transparency and enable anyone to manually audit past reward distributions.
5. **Dispute Period:** After this step, a 1-2 hour dispute period begins, during which newly computed rewards cannot be claimed yet. However, rewards from the previous Merkle root remain claimable. During this period, dispute bots verify the published reward file. If an inconsistency is found, a dispute can be raised to halt incorrect distributions before they become effective.
6. **Reward Availability:** Once the dispute period ends, users can see their rewards on any frontend integrated with the Merkl API. Users can claim rewards through a Merkl-powered frontend. Merkle proofs, required for claiming, are provided by the Merkl API or can be computed from reward files.

### Key Features

* **Single Merkl Root per Chain:** Merkl consolidates rewards from multiple campaigns into one merkle root per chain, enabling efficient batch claiming rewards from multiple different campaigns in a single transaction.
* **Aggregated Campaigns:** While campaigns operate independently, Merkl batches multiple campaign updates into a single onchain transaction
* **Automatic Catch-Up Mechanism:** If any rewards are not included in an update, they are automatically distributed in the next cycle. The Merkl engine ensures no missed rewards, processing only the data from the previous execution point.
* **Unclaimed Rewards Roll Over**: Users can claim their rewards at anytime they want: each merkle tree update takes the previous merkle tree state and simply adds the new rewards, which are then reflected in the published merkle root.

## ü§ø Deep-Dive

### Parallel Campaign Processing

Campaigns in Merkl are processed in parallel on each chain. Because campaigns are processed independently, rewards from some campaigns may be available onchain (after a merkle root update) while others are still being computed or have not been fully processed yet.

**How it works**:

* When a campaign is processed, the Merkl Engine resumes from where it last left off, ensuring no reward gaps even if updates occur at different times.
* Because onchain Merkle root updates occur separately, it is possible that:
  * Rewards for one campaign have been finalized and pushed onchain.
  * Rewards for another campaign are still pending because they weren‚Äôt processed in time for the last update.
* Merkl App/API Visibility: The Merkl app displays the last time each campaign was processed. However, note that processed rewards are not immediately claimable‚Äîthey only become available after the next Merkle root update. In this case, they appear as Pending rewards in the dashboard of a user.

### Merkl root update

Merkle root updates ‚Äî aka reward updates ‚Äî occur on average every 8 hours (ranging from 4 to 12 hours), depending on the chain.

* [Reward computation](../glossary.md#reward-computation) and [reward update](../glossary.md#reward-update) are independent
* For example, between two reward updates (8 hours apart on average), rewards are computed up to four times
* Unclaimed rewards roll over into the next reward update.

Last reward update for each chain can be viewed on the Merkl app [here](https://app.merkl.xyz/status).

### Dispute Process

If an issue is detected during the dispute period, a dispute can be raised by sending a `disputeToken` to the Merkl Distributor contract.

If the dispute is valid, the merkle root is revoked, and the disputer is refunded. If invalid, the disputer forfeits their funds, and the dispute period restarts.

Dispute conditions (`disputeToken`, `disputeAmount`, `disputePeriod`) can be retrieved from the Distributor contract on the relevant chain.

#### Open-source dispute bot

Angle Labs has developed [an open-source bot](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-dispute) to verify Merkl reward distributions. Running a dispute bot helps maintain system integrity by detecting and preventing incorrect reward allocations.

## üìå Other Key Merkl components

Beyond the Merkl engine and dispute bots described above, Merkl consists of several core components that interact to facilitate reward distribution

### Merkl Smart Contracts

Deployed on each blockchain integrated by Merkl, Merkl's smart contracts store campaign data, hold incentive tokens, and process reward claims.

These contract are [publicly available](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts) and have been audited by Code4rena ([Audit Report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-angle)).

Key contracts:

* `DistributionCreator`: Stores campaign details and configurations.
* `Distributor`: Holds tokens and processes reward claims based on merkle proofs.
* `AccessControlManager`: A multisig-controlled contract that manages disputes, fees, and access control but cannot alter distributions.

Smart contract addresses, categorized by chain are listed [here](https://app.merkl.xyz/status).

### Merkl API

[Merkl API](../integrate-merkl/app.md) provides real-time access to Merkl data, including rewards, APRs, merkle proofs, and analytics. This API enables any frontend to integrate Merkl seamlessly.

### Merkl App

[The Merkl App](https://app.merkl.xyz/), built on the Merkl API, enables users to explore reward opportunities, track APRs, and seamlessly claim their rewards.

The interface is organized around several types of pages:

* **Home page (all opportunities)** ‚Äì displays all available opportunities with filtering options
* **Opportunity page** ‚Äì dedicated view for each opportunity
* **Protocol / Chain / Liquidity program page** ‚Äì groups all opportunities related to a specific protocol, chain, or program
* **Dashboard** ‚Äì where users can claim their rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
Among these, the Opportunity page is central, as this is where you‚Äôll find the campaigns you‚Äôve created!
{% endhint %}

#### Opportunity vs. Campaign

Before using Merkl, it‚Äôs important to understand the difference between an opportunity and a campaign.

* **Campaign**: a reward distribution set by a campaign creator, with specific parameters such as [distribution type](distributions.md), reward amount, [eligibility rules](customization-options.md#eligibility), [boosts](customization-options.md#boosts), and duration. A campaign always targets a specific onchain behavior (e.g. providing liquidity in a pool, holding a token, lending/borrowing), also referred to as an opportunity.
* **Opportunity**: an asset (e.g. pool, vault,‚Ä¶) and its associated action (e.g. depositing liquidity, borrowing assets) that are incentivized.\
  Example: _Provide liquidity to the SushiswapV3 liquidity pool._

{% hint style="success" %}
**Multiple campaigns can run simultaneously on the same opportunity**. This means that for a single onchain action, a user can earn rewards from several campaigns.
{% endhint %}

#### Focus - Opportunity page

On an Opportunity page, you‚Äôll find key metrics that aggregate all active campaigns for that opportunity:

* APR
* TVL (Total Value Locked)
* Daily rewards (the amount of rewards shared each day among participants)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Group 24.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Campaign-specific info on the opportunity page</p></figcaption></figure>

Detailed info for each campaign running on the opportunity is available across several tabs:

* **Overview:** global details such as dates, APR, and eligibility rules,‚Ä¶
* **Advanced**: distribution progress, last snapshot, creator address, and campaign ID,‚Ä¶
* **Leaderboard**: list of addresses participating in the opportunity
* [**Linked opportunities**](../glossary.md#linked-opportunities) _(optional):_ displays opportunities connected through shared liquidity and rewards
