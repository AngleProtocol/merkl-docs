# Campaign Management

Once your campaign is created, you will be able to see it in the [Opportunities page](https://app.merkl.xyz/). Note that it can take up to one hour to appear in our app due to cache.

You now have the full ownership of your campaign. You’ll be able to:

* Monitor its performance using our API (refer [here](https://docs.merkl.xyz/integrate-merkl/app) for more details) or directly in the studio’s dashboard (coming soon)
* See the campaign leaderboard in the opportunity page to track addresses’ participation
* Integrate campaign data into your own app using our API. You’ll find the procedure [here](https://docs.merkl.xyz/integrate-merkl/app)
* Reallocate unclaimed rewards from any recipient to another address at your discretion. You’ll find the procedure [here](https://docs.merkl.xyz/merkl-mechanisms/features)
*   (If needed) edit some parameters of your campaigns.

    ✅ You can:

    * Change the start date & end dates if the campaign is not live yet
    * Edit blacklists or whitelists to include or exclude certain addresses
    * Enable additional features as needed

    ❌ You cannot:

    * Change the reward token
    * Decrease the total reward amount (create a new campaign for that — and shift the start/end date by at least 1 hour to avoid duplication bugs in the Merkl engine)

**Note**: If you want to add extra rewards or add another new reward token to your existing campaign, you’ll need to create another campaign on top of the current one. The new campaign must have a slightly modified start or end date (by a minimum of one hour) to prevent campaign duplication in our engine.

If you need assistance renewing your campaign, please notify us at least 3 days before it ends to ensure a smooth transition.
