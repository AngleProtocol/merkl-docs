# Fee Model

In most cases, Merkl’s fees are collected from the incentives distributed by the incentive provider. These fees support platform maintenance and ongoing development.

## Pay-as-You-Go

* A 3% campaign fee is applied.
* For JSON-based airdrops, the fee is reduced to 0.5%.
* Degressive Fee Structure – The more you distribute, the lower the effective fee, making Merkl more cost-efficient at scale.

## Subscription Model (For High-Volume Campaigns)

* Available for projects committing to over $1M in incentives annually.
* Provides a tailored pricing plan and dedicated personal support.
* Interested? Open a [BD ticket on our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jnYfrGxDbe) to discuss discounts and a customized plan.

## Unclaimed Rewards Policy

Campaign creators on Merkl can [freely reallocate](../merkl-mechanisms/features.md) all unclaimed rewards once their campaign ends.

One year after the campaign's end, if the campaign creators have not previously reallocated rewards and if there remain unclaimed rewards, Merkl reserves the right to reclaim them. This policy ensures that unused incentives are efficiently reallocated, supporting the platform’s long-term sustainability.
