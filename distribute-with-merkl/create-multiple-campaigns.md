# Create multiple campaigns

## üîÄ Step-by-step process for multiple campaigns creation

This guide provides a step-by-step process for creating a payload to launch multiple campaigns simultaneously using existing campaign models.

A multiple campaigns payload allows you to create multiple campaigns in a single transaction, saving time and gas costs. You can use existing campaigns as templates and customize their parameters to suit your needs. This guide covers how to retrieve campaign models, generate a payload, and execute it using a Safe Wallet.

### 1. Retrieve the campaign templates you want to use

To create a multiple campaigns payload, you first need to identify the campaign models you want to use as templates.

- Find the `campaignId` (0x...) of the campaign model you want to use. To do this, go in [our app](https://app.merkl.xyz/), select the opportunity and go to the "Advanced" tab.
- Input the `campaignId` in this route: [GET /v4/campaigns](https://api.merkl.xyz/docs#tag/campaigns/get/v4/campaigns/), and note down the `id` (not the `campaignId`) that appears in the first line in the response (e.g., 3011317640800818752). This is the `id` you'll use in the next step for each campaign in the batch.

If you need more help finding an `id`, you can refer to the [Merkl API v4 section](https://docs.merkl.xyz/integrate-merkl/app#understanding-the-difference-between-opportunities-and-campaigns)

### 2. Prepare the multiple campaigns payload

To generate a multiple campaigns payload from the selected campaign models, use this [endpoint](https://api.merkl.xyz/docs#tag/campaigns/post/v4/campaigns/generate-payload).

We strongly encourage you to retrieve an `id` from a campaign as close as possible to the one you wish to create: this minimizes the number of parameters you need to edit and reduces the risk of errors. For each campaign in the batch, you will have to provide the `id` from Step 1 (e.g., 3011317640800818752) in the `campaignsParams` parameter.

The list of relevant parameters you can override for each campaign type can be found in the `params` field of the response. Also, for each campaign, you will always be able to edit:
 - `amount`: amount of rewards to be distributed in a campaign
 - `computeChainId`: input the id of a chain while making sure it's a chain we already support. Supported chains can be found on our [status page](https://app.merkl.xyz/status)
 - `blacklist`: the list of addresses you want to exclude from the campaign
 - `whitelist`: the list of addresses you want to include in the campaign (excluding all others)
 
**The following base parameters will apply to the whole campaign batch. This means that if you want to create a campaign with one different parameter, you'll have to create another payload.**

- `creatorAddress`: the address creating the campaigns
- `rewardToken`: the token used for rewards for all campaigns
- `distributionChainId`: the chainId where campaigns will run
- `startTimestamp`: the start date of the campaigns (in Unix timestamp format)
- `endTimestamp`: the end date of the campaigns (in Unix timestamp format)

Note: you can go to this [page](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) to retrieve the right Unix timestamps.

Here is the list of the relevant parameters depending on the campaign type used as a template:

**ERC20LOGPROCESSOR campaigns - CampaignType: 18** (e.g., `id`: 8270489034958466914)
- `targetToken`: the 0x address of the token you want to incentivize holding (for token holding campaigns), or the 0x address of the LP token for the underlying incentivized v2 pool

**UniV3 campaigns - CampaignType: 2** (e.g., `id`: 9427880006586247706)
- `poolAddress`: the 0x address of the incentivized pool
- `weightFees`: the weight of rewards based on total fees generated, in 10,000 basis points (e.g., 5000 = 50%)
- `weightToken0`: the weight of rewards for holding token0, in 10,000 basis points (e.g., 2500 = 25%)
- `weightToken1`: the weight of rewards for holding token1, in 10,000 basis points (e.g., 2500 = 25%)
- `isOutOfRangeIncentivized`: a boolean parameter. Set to true if you want to reward out-of-range positions

**UniV4 campaigns - CampaignType: 13** (e.g., `id`: 14050222419773482936)
- `poolId`: the 0x address of the incentivized pool
- `weightFees`: the weight of rewards based on total fees generated, in 10,000 basis points (e.g., 5000 = 50%)
- `weightToken0`: the weight of rewards for holding token0, in 10,000 basis points (e.g., 2500 = 25%)
- `weightToken1`: the weight of rewards for holding token1, in 10,000 basis points (e.g., 2500 = 25%)
- `isOutOfRangeIncentivized`: a boolean parameter. Set to true if you want to reward out-of-range positions

**Morpho single token campaigns - CampaignType: 57** (e.g., `id`: 3011317640800818752)
- `targetToken`: the 0x address of the token supplied on any Morpho Market

**Euler supply campaigns - CampaignType: 12** (e.g., `id`: 16912425279432080078)
- `evkAddress`: the 0x address of the incentivized vault

**Euler borrow campaigns - CampaignType: 12** (e.g., `id`: 17331543524323336682)
- `evkAddress`: the 0x address of the incentivized vault

Once you have completed all the parameters, you can generate the payload.

Note: The best practice is to use a template campaign with the same APR type as the one you plan to use. Yet,even though we don‚Äôt recommend doing so, you can still edit the distributionType (variable, fixed, capped) of the template campaign. If you wish to do so, please reach out to us directly.

Here is an example of a UniV3 campaign creation (using template `id`: 9427880006586247706) and a lending campaign on Aave (using template `id`: 711211603263558496). When using the API route, the body will look like this:

```json
{
  "creatorAddress": "0xF057afeEc22E220f47AD4220871364e9E828b2e9",
  "rewardToken": "0x58D97B57BB95320F9a05dC918Aef65434969c2B2",
  "distributionChainId": 1,
  "startTimestamp": 1756512000,
  "endTimestamp": 1756598400,
  "campaignsParams": {
    "9427880006586247706": [
      {
        "amount": "85372895000000000000000",
        "poolAddress": "0x2A2C512beAA8eB15495726C235472D82EFFB7A6B",
        "weightToken0": 1500,
        "weightToken1": 1500,
        "weightFees": 7000,
        "blacklist": [],
        "forwarders": [],
        "hooks": []
      },
      {
        "amount": "5753425000000000000000000",
        "poolAddress": "0x2A2C512beAA8eB15495726C235472D82EFFB7A6B",
        "weightToken0": 1500,
        "weightToken1": 1500,
        "weightFees": 3000,
        "blacklist": [],
        "forwarders": [],
        "hooks": []
      }
    ],
    "711211603263558496": [
      {
        "amount": "48500000000000000000000",
        "distributionMethodParameters": {
          "distributionMethod": "FIX_APR",
          "distributionSettings": {
            "apr": "0.15",
            "targetToken": "0xE3190143Eb552456F88464662f0c0C4aC67A77eB",
            "symbolTargetToken": "aHorRwaRLUSD",
            "rewardTokenPricing": true,
            "targetTokenPricing": true,
            "decimalsTargetToken": 18
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Generate the multiple campaigns payload

The response contains two objects:

- `campaignPayloads`: A Safe payload for creating the campaigns
- `simulatedCampaigns`: A preview simulation of the campaigns that will be created from this payload

Once the payload is generated, you can check the `simulatedCampaigns` section to confirm the campaigns match your expectations (e.g., tokens, amounts, timestamps, etc), and to preview what will be displayed in our app (title, description, etc)

Then, copy only the `campaignPayloads` value from the response (not the `simulatedCampaigns` part), and drag and drop it in Gnosis Safe Transaction Builder to then execute the onchain transaction, which will create the campaigns.

You're done! The campaigns will appear in our app shortly!

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Create batch campaigns or multiple campaigns at once (2nd method)

If you're planning to launch several campaigns simultaneously ‚Äî for example, as part of a protocol-level program or a chain-wide initiative ‚Äî please reach out to us on Telegram so we can better support you and fast-track the operational setup and onboarding. If we‚Äôre not already in contact, you can open a BD ticket on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kZVG3T6Z)

### Set up

To get started, you‚Äôll need to provide:

* The assets you'd like to incentivize
* Any customization options you'd like to apply (you can read more about supported customization options [here](https://docs.merkl.xyz/merkl-mechanisms/hooks))

Once provided, we‚Äôll save this configuration on our end and generate the corresponding **keys** needed to launch your campaigns in bulk. We will share with you these keys via a GitHub Gist.

Once your configuration is set, you‚Äôll be able to create multiple campaigns at once, all sharing the same following base parameters:

* `program`: Provided by us ‚Äì the internal ID of your incentive program
* `creator`: The Safe address that will execute the campaign payload
* `rewardToken`: In checksum format
* `distributionChainId`: The chain where the rewards will be distributed
* `startTimestamp`: Campaign start time (Unix)
* `endTimestamp`: Campaign end time (Unix)

This setup is particularly useful for protocols or chains running recurring or large-scale programs. For example, a chain running a coordinated incentive program may want to incentivize its DEXes, lending protocols, vaults, and more ‚Äî all with aligned campaign durations and launch timing.

### Payload Generation

You can generate your campaign payloads using this endpoint: [https://api.merkl.xyz/docs#tag/programpayload/POST/v4/program-payload/program/withAmounts](https://api.merkl.xyz/docs#tag/programpayload/POST/v4/program-payload/program/withAmounts).

To use it:

1. Input the base parameters listed above.
2. In the request body, paste the JSON file with the **keys and placeholder amounts** we provided via GitHub Gist. You can find an example below in the example section.
3. For each key:
   * Replace the placeholder amount with the number of tokens you want to allocate (in raw units).
   * Use the correct number of decimals (e.g., `5000000000000000000` for 5 tokens if the token has 18 decimals).
   * **If you do not plan to incentivize a specific key, do not set the amount to `0`. Instead, remove the key entirely from the JSON.**
4. Click Send. If the payload is successfully generated, you‚Äôll be able to download it. If not, there may be an error, feel free to reach out to us ‚Äî we‚Äôll help troubleshoot.
5. Download the generated payload and drag it into the Safe Transaction Builder to execute it.

### Example

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a chain and want to incentivize:

* 5 Uniswap pools
* 2 Euler vaults

You would send us the addresses of the pools and vaults you want to incentivize. Once received, we‚Äôll configure your setup and return the associated keys via a GitHub Gist.

The Gist will follow this format:

```json
{
    "ProtocolName1 Asset_Incentivized_1 ProgramName Address": "100000000000000000000",
    "ProtocolName1 Asset_Incentivized_2 ProgramName Address": "100000000000000000000",
    "ProtocolName2 Asset_Incentivized_3 ProgramName Address": "100000000000000000000"
}
```

For example, it would look like this:

```json
{
    "Uniswap USDC/WETH ProgramName 0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640": "100000000000000000000",
    "Uniswap WETH/USDT ProgramName 0xc7bbec68d12a0d1830360f8ec58fa599ba1b0e9b": "100000000000000000000",
    "Uniswap WBTC/WETH ProgramName 0x4585fe77225b41b697c938b018e2ac67ac5a20c0": "100000000000000000000",
    "Uniswap wstETH/WETH ProgramName 0x109830a1aaad605bbf02a9dfa7b0b92ec2fb7daa": "100000000000000000000",
    "Uniswap WBTC/cbBTC ProgramName 0xe8f7c89c5efa061e340f2d2f206ec78fd8f7e124": "100000000000000000000",
    "Euler Supply WETH ProgramName 0xD8b27CF359b7D15710a5BE299AF6e7Bf904984C2": "100000000000000000000",
    "Euler Borrow USDC ProgramName 0xE62055e3f732AB523FB57dDfAbA873a19C8A2CF8": "100000000000000000000"
}
```

The values(`100000000000000000000`) are placeholder values. When creating your campaigns, you‚Äôll need to replace them with the actual amounts you want to allocate. _All amounts must be entered in raw format using the correct token decimals._

Then proceed with the steps outlined in the Payload Generation section above.

### Considerations Before Generating a Payload

* **Minimum Rewards Threshold:** Each campaign must meet the minimum hourly token distribution (typically ‚â• \~$1/hour). If a campaign in the payload falls below this threshold, the payload will not be generated and will return an error message.
* **Duplicate Campaigns:** If you're reusing the same keys to increase rewards for an existing campaign, you‚Äôll need to modify the `startTimestamp` or `endTimestamp` slightly (e.g., by 1 second) to avoid a duplicate campaign error.
* **Payload Size Limitations:** If your payload is too large, Safe may fail to execute the transaction. In that case, split your campaigns into multiple smaller batches. Creating up to \~20 campaigns at once typically works fine.
* **Decimal Precision:** Ensure the amounts you distribute match the token's decimals. For example, for an 18-decimal token, `1 token = 1000000000000000000`.
