# Types of campaign



**Before starting your campaign**, and using your reward token as an incentive token on Merkl, we need some information to make sure that we’ll be able to properly compute APRs, and that it’ll be safe for our users. For us to whitelist your token, please fill out the following [form](https://tally.so/r/3y2bqx).

**Remember, one of Merkl's core features is the ability to incentivize activity on one chain while distributing rewards on another.**

Merkl supports 5 types of campaigns:

1. **Concentrated Liquidity Pool (CLAMM) Incentivization Campaign**
2. **Airdrop Campaign**
3. **ERC20 Incentivization Campaign (Token, LP Tokens, and Lending and Borrowing Token Balance Incentives)**
4. **Lending and Borrowing Incentivization Campaign on Silo and Radiant**
5. **Token Snapshot Campaign**

## 1. Concentrated Liquidity Pool (CLAMM) Incentivization Campaign

* For a detailed guide on how to set up your concentrated liquidity pool (CLAMM) incentivization campaign, [check out this page](https://app.merkl.xyz/create/pool)

{% endcontent-ref %}

* When you're ready to start incentivizing the concentrated liquidity pool of your choice, create your concentrated liquidity incentivization campaign using [Merkl's CLAMM Campaign creation tool](https://app.merkl.xyz/create/pool). **Before you begin, do not forget to whitelist the tokens you want to incentivize the liquidity pool with, by filling out this** [form](https://tally.so/r/3y2bqx).

## 3. ERC20 Incentivization Campaign (Token, LP Token, and Lending and Borrowing Token Balance)

ERC20 campaigns incorporate various aspects such as token balance, LP token balance (liquidity pool V2), and lending and borrowing protocols. Since all these protocols are based on ERC20 tokens, Merkl can integrate them by default, ensuring that users participating in different activities can earn rewards.&#x20;

However, for V2 AMMs and lending and borrowing protocols, **we strongly recommend you to be fully supported by Merkl**. The advantages of being supported by Merkl include APR and TVL calculations, among other benefits. Additionally, you can create protocol-specific or campaign-specific types of campaigns for more tailored incentives.

The current supported lending and borrowing protocols by Merkl are:

* Silo (protocol-specific campaigns)
* Radiant (protocol-specific campaigns)
* Compound
* Gearbox
* Ionic
* Sturdy
* Metamorpho Lending

Merkl also currently support the following V2 AMMs:

* Uniswap V2
* Balancer V2
* Velodrome V2
* Aerodrome V2
* Fenix V2
* Poolside V2
* Quickswap V2

if you want your AMM V2, or lending and borrowing protocol to be fully integrated and supported by Merkl, or to create protocol or campaign-specific campaigns (as we did for Silo and Radiant), please [contact us on the Merkl Discord by opening a BD ticket](https://discord.com/invite/jnYfrGxDbe) to discuss the integration process. Integration allows APRs and TVL calculations.&#x20;
