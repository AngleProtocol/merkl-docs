# Test campaigns

**Merkl is not deployed on testnets, but you can still run test campaigns using our test token: aglaMerkl**

These campaigns will **not appear on the Merkl app** and will not be visible to users, as they are automatically filtered out from the interface.

To get started, send us a message and we’ll provide you with our test token. aglaMerkl has no value and is only intended for creating test campaigns on Merkl.

You can then create your test campaign using aglaMerkl tokens. While the campaign won’t show up in the Merkl app, you’ll be able to **check everything is working properly via the Merkl API**, using the campaign ID generated at creation.

Make sure to verify that:

* distribution is functioning as expected
* key metrics like TVL are correctly computed

If everything looks good in the API, it will appear correctly in the Merkl front end once the real campaign is live!
