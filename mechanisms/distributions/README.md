# üí∏ Distribution Types

Merkl supports various distribution methods, allowing campaign creators to choose how rewards are allocated based on participant activity and liquidity contributions.

## üìà Variable APR Campaigns

In Variable APR campaigns, rewards are distributed proportionally based on time-weighted liquidity within the eligibility pool.

This is the most classical form of campaign.

### Key Characteristics

- Constant reward rate for campaign creators: A fixed amount of tokens is distributed per second, regardless of liquidity changes.
- Variable rewards for participants: As more users join, rewards per user decrease (like slicing a fixed-size pizza into more pieces).
- Prefunded & fixed duration: The full campaign budget is deposited upfront, and the campaign runs for a set time.

### Example: Liquidity Pool Incentives

Imagine an incentive program targeting liquidity in a pool:

- Day Start: Two LPs each contribute \$100 (50%/50%).
- Midday: A third LP adds $200 (total pool: \$400).

As a result:

- The first two LPs each get 50 tokens for their contribution in the first half of the day, then 25 tokens each for the second half.
- The third LP, who contributed \$200 in the second half, receives 50% of the rewards for that period, which is 50 tokens.

Result: Early participants earn more rewards before new LPs enter, while later participants dilute the total yield for others.

### Anti DoS Measures

To prevent excessive computational load and spam, Merkl applies an anti-DoS filter to Variable APR campaigns.

- Users earning less than 0.000001% of total campaign rewards per engine run are excluded.
- This prevents micro-distributions that could disrupt system performance.

Example: Uniswap V2 Liquidity Pool Campaign

- Campaign Duration: 14 days
- Total Value Locked (TVL): \$1,000,000 (on Arbitrum)
- Merkl Engine Run Frequency: Every 4 hours (6 times per day)

For this campaign:

- Each reward distribution releases 1/84th of the total rewards (1 / (14 days √ó 6 runs per day)).
- If a user provides $10 of liquidity, they represent 1/100,000th (0.001%) of the total TVL ($10 / \$1,000,000).
- Per engine run, their potential reward would be 1/8,400,000th (0.000012%) of the total rewards (1/100,000 √ó 1/84).
- Since this is above the 1/100,000,000th (0.000001%) threshold, the reward would be distributed.

However, if the TVL increased to \$20,000,000, the same user‚Äôs share would drop to 1/2,000,000th (0.00005%), and their per-run reward would be 1/16,800,000th (0.0000006%), below the threshold. As a result, they would not receive rewards.

## üîí Fixed rate campaigns

In Fixed rate campaigns, users earn a predefined amount of rewards per unit of liquidity at a set rate.

### Key Characteristics

- Constant reward rate per users: Users receive a fixed APR regardless of total liquidity.
- Variable cost for campaign creators: As more users join, the overall cost increases, but individual earnings remain stable.
- Budget-constrained: Campaigns end when funds are depleted or when the scheduled duration expires. If a campaign runs out of funds before its end date, rewards are split proportionally (like a Variable APR campaign) in the final run. If the campaign ends early, unused rewards are returned to the campaign creator.

### Example: Fixed APR Campaign

A campaign offers $1 in rewards per $100 in liquidity per day - which makes a 365% fixed APR.

- If TVL = $100, the cost is $1 per day.
- If TVL = $100 million, the cost for the campaign creator scales to $1M per day.

You can also incentivise by number of token hold. Let's say that Bob want to incentivise holding *LONG* and he doesn't know how to price it.

A campaign can offer $1 in rewards per 100 *LONG* hold per day.


### üéØ The Special Case of Points

This distribution method is widely used in point systems. Traditionally in points systems, users earn points for completing a specific action (like providing \$1 of liquidity in a pool for a day), regardless of how many other people did.

The main difference here in fixed APR campaigns for points is that when distributing points, the budget is effectively unlimited; and so campaign creators can allocate as many points as they want, allowing the campaign to last indefinitely.

#### Example: Points

Bob wants to incentivise holding his token *LONG* with a point token named *BOB*.

If *LONG* has a dollar value, Bob can create a campaign that offers 1 *BOB* in rewards per \$1 hold of *LONG* in liquidity per day.
But Bob can also create a campaign that offers 1 *BOB* in rewards per X *LONG* hold in liquidity per day, when he doesn't want to take into account the $ value.


## Coming Soon: Max APR campaigns

These campaigns are variable APR campaigns which become fixed APR campaigns when they start distributing too much.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

While Merkl distribution types vary in how rewards accrue and distribute over time‚Äîwhether linearly or non-linearly‚Äîone key factor remains the same:

- New rewards only become claimable after a Merkle root update.
- These updates occur at fixed intervals, which vary by chain (typically every 4 to 12 hours, with an average of 8 hours).

**Example in a Variable APR campaign**:

- You create a 14-day campaign with a \$42,000 budget.
- Merkle root updates occur every 8 hours (3 times per day).
- Total updates during the campaign: 42 runs (14 days √ó 3 runs/day).
- Rewards per update:
  - $42,000 √∑ 42 runs = $1,000 per run.
  - Users can claim \$1,000 from the allocated rewards at each update.

Although rewards are continuously calculated, they only become available for claiming when the Merkle root is updated onchain.
