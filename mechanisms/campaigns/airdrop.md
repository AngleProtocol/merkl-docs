# üèπ Airdrop Campaigns

Merkl supports airdrop campaigns, simplifying the process for protocols looking to airdrop tokens to their community by allowing them to get it done in a few minutes with just a few clicks while minimizing gas fees.

In airdrop campaigns, incentive providers are responsible for allocating the rewards to their users (i.e choosing which users should get a set amount of rewards) and Merkl is used to handle the distribution through the usual claim system.

The only thing that is expected from reward providers is to come with a JSON file.

With airdrops, you are responsible for allocating the rewards to the users and Merkl is responsible for handling the distribution of the tokens through our claim system.

## Token Balance Airdrops

For the protocols that do not have a JSON file ready for addresses to receive rewards, Merkl also provides the possibility to airdrop tokens to token holders based on their snapshoted token balance at a chosen moment in time.
