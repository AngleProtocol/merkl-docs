# Token Snapshot

Token Snapshot allows protocols to take a snapshot of token balances at a specific block height. This snapshot can then be used to identify and verify the token holdings of users at that particular moment, which is crucial for fair and accurate distribution of rewards.&#x20;

Merkl's Token Snapshot functionality provides a powerful tool to capture and utilize token balances at specific points in time. This feature enables a variety of applications, including boosted staking rewards, rewards for governance participation, airdrops distribution, and more.&#x20;
