# Concentrated Liquidity (V3) Pools

Concentrated liquidity allows liquidity providers to allocate their capital within specific price ranges, making their liquidity more efficient and potentially earning higher rewards. This targeted approach maximizes capital efficiency but comes with the risk that if the market price moves outside of the specified range, the position can become inactive, and no rewards are earned.
