## Constant Product Liquidity Pools (such as UniSwap V2)

**Merkl natively supports all Constant Product Liquidity Pools because they utilize ERC20 tokens, and Merkl is compatible with all ERC20 tokens.** However, if you want your Constant Product AMM to be fully integrated and supported by Merkl, please contact us on the [Merkl Discord by opening a BD ticket](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/jnYfrGxDbe\&sa=D\&source=docs\&ust=1714726869927696\&usg=AOvVaw1loOKjqz9IGEdpNjWsvrmD) to discuss the integration process. **The advantages of being supported by Merkl include APR and TVL calculations, among other benefits.**

## Lending and Borrowing Protocols

Since lending and borrowing tokens are ERC20 tokens, and Merkl is compatible with all ERC20 tokens, **Merkl natively supports all lending and borrowing protocols that issue receipt tokens and debt tokens.**

However, if you want your Lending and Borrowing protocol to be fully integrated and supported by Merkl, please contact us on the [Merkl Discord by opening a BD ticket](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/jnYfrGxDbe\&sa=D\&source=docs\&ust=1714726869927696\&usg=AOvVaw1loOKjqz9IGEdpNjWsvrmD) to discuss the integration process. **The advantages of being supported by Merkl include APR and TVL calculations, among other benefits.**

* **For Users:** Find out how using Merkl to supply liquidity to lending and borrowing platforms can help you earn higher APR on your lending positions and reduce your APRs on your borrowing positions.
