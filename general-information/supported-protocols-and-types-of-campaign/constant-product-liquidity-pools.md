# Constant Product Liquidity Pools

Constant Product Liquidity Pools (such as UniSwapV2) allow users to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges. Unlike concentrated liquidity, the LP token is an ERC20 token rather than an NFT. This ERC20 property enables **Merkl to natively support any Constant Product Liquidity Pool.**

However, **we strongly recommend you to be fully supported by Merkl.** The advantages of being supported by Merkl include APRs and TVL calculations, among other benefits.

Merkl currently support the following Constant Product AMMs:

* Uniswap V2
* Balancer V2
* Velodrome V2
* Aerodrome V2
* Fenix V2
* Poolside V2
* Quickswap V2

If your protocol is not part of the list and you want to integrate your Constant Product AMM with Merkl, please contact us on the [Merkl Discord by opening a BD ticket](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/jnYfrGxDbe\&sa=D\&source=docs\&ust=1714726869927696\&usg=AOvVaw1loOKjqz9IGEdpNjWsvrmD) to discuss the integration process. Integration allows APRs and TVL calculations.
