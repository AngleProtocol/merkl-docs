# Lending and Borrowing Protocols

Lending and borrowing protocols allow users to lend their assets to earn interest or borrow assets against collateral. **Merkl natively supports any Lending and Borrowing protocol** because they utilize ERC20 tokens, and Merkl is compatible with all ERC20 tokens.&#x20;

However, **we strongly recommend you to be fully supported by Merkl**. The advantages of being supported by Merkl include APR and TVL calculations, among other benefits. Additionally, you can create protocol-specific or campaign-specific types of campaigns for more tailored incentives.

The current supported lending and borrowing protocols are:

* Silo (protocol-specific campaigns)
* Radiant (protocol-specific campaigns)
* Compound
* Gearbox
* Ionic
* Sturdy
* Metamorpho Lending

if you want your lending and borrowing protocol to be fully integrated and supported by Merkl, or to create protocol or campaign-specific campaigns (as we did for Silo and Radiant), please [contact us on the Merkl Discord by opening a BD ticket](https://discord.com/invite/jnYfrGxDbe) to discuss the integration process. Integration allows APRs and TVL calculations.&#x20;
