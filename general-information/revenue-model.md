# Revenue Model

All fees are collected from the incentive provider, never the user. These fees are allocated towards platform maintenance and development.

We offer two revenue models:

1. **Pay-as-You-Go**: A 3% campaign fee is applied, while for airdrops, this fee is reduced to 0.5%.
2. **Subscription**: This model is available for projects that commit to incentivizing more than $1M in rewards over a year utilizing Merkl's platform. A tailored plan and personal support will be provided. If you are interested, please open a [BD ticket on our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jnYfrGxDbe) to discuss discounts and a customized plan.&#x20;

Additionally, Merkl reserves the right to claim any unclaimed rewards after one year. This policy ensures that unutilized incentives are reallocated efficiently, maintaining the sustainability of the platform.
