## What is Merkl?

Merkl is a DeFi incentive platform that connects liquidity providers with protocols looking to boost activity and engagement.

- For Users: Earn rewards or points by participating in incentive campaigns.

Merkl supports a wide range of use cases, including:

✔ Liquidity incentives for AMMs (e.g., Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2)

✔ Yield aggregator incentives for liquidity providers
✔ Token holding rewards based on balance over time
✔ Retroactive airdrops with custom eligibility criteria
✔ Custom Onchain Incentives: Track and reward any onchain action, from governance participation to vault deposits, staking behaviors, and beyond.

Merkl also supports multiple campaign structures and reward distribution models:

- Variable APR: Rewards are distributed proportionally over time based on user contributions.
- Fixed APR: Rewards accrue at a consistent rate, independent of other participants.
- Custom and more complex structures: Campaigns can be tailored to fit unique incentives and protocol needs.

At its core, Merkl operates on an offchain engine that processes both onchain and offchain data to compute rewards and points for campaigns.
