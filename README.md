# Merkl Documentation Portal

Merkl is a DeFi incentive platform that **connects liquidity providers with protocols** looking to boost activity and engagement.

* For Protocols: Launch, manage, and customize growth campaigns to attract liquidity, track user engagement, and distribute incentives without the usual operational burden.
* For Users: Earn rewards or points by participating in incentive campaigns.

At its core, Merkl operates on an offchain engine that processes both onchain and offchain data to compute rewards and points for campaigns.
