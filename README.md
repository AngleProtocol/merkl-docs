## What is Merkl

Merkl is an innovative platform designed to optimize and streamline liquidity and rewards distribution in the DeFi space. By leveraging advanced off-chain data analysis and computing on-chain actions, Merkl enables efficient and accurate reward allocations for various DeFi activities. These include incentivizing liquidity provisioning in both V2 and V3 liquidity pools, lending protocols, yield aggregators, and distributing rewards for holding tokens or through airdrops.

Merkl's building blocks are its campaigns. Campaigns are created on-chain by liquidity incentive providers and contain all the configurations for incentive distribution as set by the incentivizer. Our off-chain engine processes these campaigns to reward users based on the provided configuration. Campaigns allow users to grow and earn competitive revenues with ease, while guaranteeing protocols for distributing incentives simply, easily and without operational hassle.

&#x20;Merkl is also the first tool to enable incentivizing UniV3 liquidity pools!

## Our mission

Our mission is to create a seamless and efficient reward distribution system that maximizes the benefits for both users and incentive providers in the DeFi ecosystem. We aim to provide a transparent, reliable, and user-friendly platform that drives engagement and growth in DeFi.&#x20;
