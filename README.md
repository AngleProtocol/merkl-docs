## What is Merkl

Merkl is an innovative platform designed to optimize and streamline liquidity and rewards distribution in DeFi. By leveraging advanced offchain data analysis and computing onchain actions, Merkl enables efficient and accurate reward allocations for various DeFi activities. These include incentivizing liquidity provisioning in both V2 and V3 liquidity pools, lending protocols, yield aggregators, and distributing rewards for holding tokens or through airdrops.

Merkl's building blocks are its campaigns. Campaigns are created onchain by incentive providers and contain all the configurations for incentive distribution as set by the incentive provider. The Merkl offchain engine processes these campaigns to reward users based on the provided configuration. Campaigns allow users to earn competitive revenues with ease, while enabling protocols to distribute incentives easily, quickly and without operational hassle.

Merkl was also the first tool to enable UniswapV3 liquidity pools incentivization!

## Our mission

We strive to create a seamless and efficient reward distribution system that maximizes the benefits for both users and incentive providers in the DeFi ecosystem. We aim to provide a transparent, reliable, and user-friendly platform that drives engagement and growth in DeFi.
