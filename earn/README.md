# Earn with Merkl

All yield opportunities using Merkl are listed at [app.merkl.xyz](https://app.merkl.xyz).

This interface displays the different campaigns and their types. For every opportunity, you may find a link for where to deposit your funds.

Once you deposit your funds or perform the actions for an opportunity incentivized with Merkl, no additional steps are required to start receiving your rewards. You will be able to claim them directly from the Merkl page or from any other app which integrates Merkl. In particular, **you will not need to stake your tokens anywhere else**.

Rewards on Merkl do not increase block by block, but can be claimed at a frequency which depends [on the chain](https://app.merkl.xyz/status).

Merkl comes with an anti DoS filter which means that positions with less than \$20 of liquidity are not eligible for incentives.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that on Merkl, by default rewards can only be claimed by the address which earned the rewards. If you want to claim rewards on behalf of another address you will need to open a ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tZPwmgqH) so that the team can whitelist your address.

In the following pages, we explain in more details how to take advantage of the different campaign types on Merkl to earn rewards.
