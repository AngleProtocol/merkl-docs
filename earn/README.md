# Earn with Merkl

All yield opportunities using Merkl are listed at [merkl.angle.money](https://merkl.angle.money).

This interface displays the different campaigns and their types. For every opportunity, you may find a link for where to deposit your funds.

In all cases, keep in mind that rewards on Merkl do not increase block by block, but can be claimed at [a frequency](./helpers.md#🔗-live-amms-and-chains) which depends on the chain.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that on Merkl, rewards can be claimed by any address on behalf of any other address. If you are integrating Merkl as a smart contract and don't want rewards to be claimed on your behalf, you can call the `toggleOnlyOperatorCanClaim` function on the `Distributor` contract (address [here](./helpers.md#🧑‍💻-smart-contracts)).
{% endhint %}

In the following pages, we explain how to take advantage of the different campaign types on Merkl to earn rewards.
