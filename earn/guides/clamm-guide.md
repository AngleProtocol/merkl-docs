# ðŸŒŠ Earn from Concentrated Liquidity Campaigns

As a Liquidity Provider, Merkl lets you customize your concentrated liquidity position to optimize your returns.

To receive rewards from a concentrated liquidity campaign on Merkl, you can provide liquidity directly on one of the listed pools, or on one of the supported position / liquidity managers. If you are using a liquidity manager, be careful to understand how they rebalance liquidity.

The main choices you need to make when adding liquidity are:

- how tight should the positionâ€™s range be
- what should the split between the two tokens be

For example, a tight range will virtually provide more liquidity and earn more fees and rewards. However, it has more chances to become out-of-range and suffer from impermanent loss.

Once you have provided liquidity, no additional steps are required to start receiving your rewards. You will be able to claim them directly from the Merkl page or from any other app which integrates Merkl. In particular, **you will not need to stake your tokens anywhere else**.
If you were providing liquidity on a pool (directly on the AMM or through a liquidity position manager) before the incentive was created on Merkl, you will also be eligible to claim your rewards when they are distributed.
