# ðŸŒŠ Earn from Concentrated Liquidity Campaigns

As a Liquidity Provider, Merkl lets you customize your concentrated liquidity position to optimize your returns.

To receive rewards from a concentrated liquidity campaign on Merkl, you can provide liquidity directly on one of the listed pools, or on one of the supported position / liquidity managers.

If you are using a liquidity manager, be careful to understand how they rebalance liquidity.

The main choices you need to make when adding liquidity are:

- how tight the positionâ€™s range should be
- what the split between the two tokens should be

For example, a tight range will virtually provide more liquidity and earn more fees and rewards. However, it has more chances to become out-of-range and suffer from impermanent loss.

If you were providing liquidity on a pool (directly on the AMM or through a liquidity position manager) before the incentive was created on Merkl, you will also be eligible to claim your rewards when they are distributed.

## Fake volume attacks detection

Merkl automatically detects users who try to game the reward system by creating very tight positions and trading against themselves (wash trading). These users are automatically blacklisted. If you've been blacklisted and want to understand why or ask us to remove you from the blacklist, please open a support ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/47mmUUwfMu). Please note that we can only un-blacklist an address and will not send the funds that should've been earned by the position while the address was blacklisted.
