# AMM integration

If you want your Automated Market Maker (AMM) to be integrated into the Merkl system, please fill out this [form](https://tally.so/r/3XJODP).

**Benefits of Integration:**

* **Increased Liquidity**: Attract more liquidity providers by offering additional rewards through the Merkl system.
* **Enhanced Visibility**: Gain exposure to a broader audience of DeFi users who are actively looking for rewarding opportunities.
* **Seamless Integration**: Our integration process is straightforward and designed to minimize disruption, allowing you to quickly benefit from the Merkl ecosystem.
* **Comprehensive Support**: Receive dedicated support from the Merkl team to ensure a smooth and successful integration.

**How It Works:**

1. **Submit the Form**: Provide the necessary details about your AMM and your specific integration requirements.
2. **Review and Approval**: Our team will review your submission and get in touch with you to discuss the integration process in detail.
3. **Technical Integration**: Work with our technical team to integrate your AMM into the Merkl system. The Merkl Engine will be configured to:
   * **Detect New Positions**: Capture when new positions are created or deleted in your AMM pools.
   * **Monitor Swaps**: Detect all swaps occurring in these pools to ensure accurate reward distribution.
   * **Fetch LP Position Information**: Gather comprehensive information on all liquidity provider (LP) positions.
4. **Launch**: Once integrated, your AMM will be live on the Merkl platform, and you can start incentivizing liquidity providers immediately.

Integrating with Merkl not only enhances your platform's capabilities but also provides your users with additional incentives to participate in your liquidity pools.
