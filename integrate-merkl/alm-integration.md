# ALM integration

If you want your Automated Market Maker (AMM) to be integrated into the Merkl system, please fill out this [form](https://tally.so/r/w4JYLr).

**Benefits of Integration:**

* **Increased Participation:** Attract more liquidity providers by offering additional rewards through the Merkl system.
* **Enhanced Visibility:** Gain exposure to a broader audience of DeFi users who are actively looking for rewarding opportunities.
* **Seamless Integration:** Our integration process is straightforward and designed to minimize disruption, allowing you to quickly benefit from the Merkl ecosystem.
* **Comprehensive Support:** Receive dedicated support from the Merkl team to ensure a smooth and successful integration.

**How It Works:**

1. **Submit the Form:** Provide the necessary details about your ALM and your specific integration requirements.
2. **Review and Approval:** Our team will review your submission and get in touch with you to discuss the integration process in detail.
3. **Technical Integration:** Work with our technical team to integrate your ALM into the Merkl system. The Merkl Engine will be configured to track all your liquidity positions as well as the distribution of your Liquidity Providers within your vault to ensure accurate reward forwarding.
4. **Launch:** Once integrated, your ALM will be live on the Merkl platform, and you can start incentivizing lenders and borrowers immediately.

Integrating with Merkl not only enhances your ALM's capabilities but also provides your Liquidity Providers with additional incentives to participate in your liquidity management.
