# FAQ

#### What is Merkl ? What types of campaign does Merkl support ?

* Merkl is a platform that offers various yield opportunities in DeFi by providing incentives through Incentive Providers (IPs) for liquidity providers, lenders, and borrowers. It allows users to earn rewards by participating in different campaigns and protocols. \
  \
  Additionally, Merkl supports airdrop, token snapshot, and token balance functionalities for IPs, allowing users to potentially receive additional tokens in their wallets. To see if you are eligible for any of these rewards, check your user [dashboard](https://app.merkl.xyz/user).

#### How do I start earning rewards on Merkl?&#x20;

* To start earning rewards on Merkl:

1. Visit [app.merkl.xyz](https://app.merkl.xyz).
2. Explore the various opportunities and find the one that suits you best.
3. Invest your liquidity directly on the protocol's app using the provided links.
4. Connect your wallet and start depositing your liquidity, lending  or borrowing the incentivized token.
5. Check the user [dashboard](https://app.merkl.xyz/user) to track your positions and claim your rewards.&#x20;

#### Do I need to stake my tokens to earn rewards ?&#x20;

* No, you do not need to stake your tokens elsewhere. Once you deposit your funds or perform the required actions for an opportunity incentivized by Merkl, you will start receiving rewards without additional steps.

#### How can I track my positions and rewards on Merkl ?&#x20;

* You can track your active positions and rewards through the Merkl user [dashboard](https://app.merkl.xyz/user). This dashboard provides a clear view of your investments and earnings.

#### How can I claim my rewards ?&#x20;

* You can claim your rewards directly from the Merkl user [dashboard](https://app.merkl.xyz/user) or any other app that integrates with Merkl. Rewards can be claimed at a frequency that depends on the chain. Check the claim frequency [here](https://app.merkl.xyz/status). However, claiming is not required at every reward distribution; you can accumulate your rewards and claim them at a later time.

#### Are there any requirements for earning and claiming rewards ?&#x20;

* Yes, users earning less than 1/10,000,000th (0.00001%) of the campaign rewards per engine run are not eligible for incentives.
* **For concentrated liquidity only,** positions with less than $20 of liquidity are not eligible for incentives.&#x20;
* Rewards can only be claimed by the address that earned them. If you need to claim rewards on behalf of another address, please open a tech ticket in our Discord to have your address whitelisted.

#### How often are rewards distributed on Merkl ?&#x20;

* Rewards are distributed every 3 to 12 hours, known as distribution epochs, depending on the chain the campaign is running on. To learn when is the next distribution epoch of the campaign you have positions in, check this [link](https://app.merkl.xyz/status). Claiming is not required at every epoch as unclaimed rewards can be accumulated and claimed later. For more details on distribution epochs, [click here](../merkl-mechanisms/architecture-and-technical-overview/).

#### Can I claim rewards from multiple campaigns in one transaction ?&#x20;

* Yes, Merkl aggregates rewards from multiple campaigns into a single Merkle Root, allowing you to claim all your rewards in one transaction.

**What happens if there is an issue with the reward distribution?**

* If there is an issue with the reward distribution, it will be addressed during the dispute period. During this time, anyone can contest the distribution by submitting a disputeToken (either 100 EURa or the equivalent amount in the chain's native gas token). If a dispute is valid, the merkle root is revoked and corrected. If invalid, the dispute period restarts. For more details on dispute period, [click here](../merkl-mechanisms/architecture-and-technical-overview/).

**Can I earn rewards from multiple incentive providers?**

* Yes, Merkl supports multiple incentive providers for the same type of campaign. You will receive rewards from all applicable incentive providers you have positions in when you claim your rewards.

**Are all Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) protocols supported by Merkl?**

No.  All AMMs and ALMs shown on Merkl's app have been whitelisted and integrated into Merkl, ensuring that you can safely invest your liquidity across various platforms. For a comprehensive list of supported AMMs and ALMs, check this [link](https://app.merkl.xyz/integrations).

#### How do I earn with concentrated liquidity on Merkl ?&#x20;

* To earn with concentrated liquidity on Merkl:

1. Provide liquidity directly in one of the incentivized pools via the protocol's app. Merkl provides direct links to these apps for easy access.
2. Choose the range tightness and token split for your liquidity position.
3. Alternatively, provide liquidity through one of the supported Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) protocols that has position(s) in the incentivized concentrated liquidity pool. If you are using an ALM protocol, be careful to understand how they rebalance liquidity.

#### What should I be aware of when using concentrated liquidity pools ?&#x20;

Concentrated liquidity pools offer higher returns but come with specific risks. Ensure your positions are actively managed to stay within the effective range to maximize your rewards. If your liquidity position is out of range during a swap, you won't be eligible for rewards for that period.

#### How can I earn passively on Merkl ?&#x20;

For airdrop, token balance, and token snapshot campaigns, simply check your user dashboard to see if you're one of the lucky recipients of rewards from a Merkl Incentive Provider (IP). No additional action is required to start earning passively from these campaigns.
