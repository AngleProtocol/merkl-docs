# ðŸ’° Earn with Merkl

All yield opportunities using Merkl are listed at [app.merkl.xyz](https://app.merkl.xyz).

This interface displays the different campaigns and their types. For every opportunity, you will find a link to deposit your funds directly on the respective protocol's app. Once you deposit your funds or perform the required actions for an opportunity incentivized by Merkl, no additional steps are required to start receiving your rewards. You can claim them directly from the [Merkl dashboard](https://app.merkl.xyz/user) or any other app that integrates with Merkl. In particular, **you will not need to stake your tokens anywhere else**.

The Merkl engine is compatible with multiple incentive providers incentivizing the same type of campaigns (e.g., the same pool on UniswapV3) with potentially different parameters. If you are eligible for a campaign on Merkl, you will claim rewards from all incentive providers who have incentivized your behavior when claiming your rewards. This means that many teams can incentivize a specific behavior at the same time with different tokens.

Additionally, you can claim all your tokens in one click per chain, making the process seamless and efficient.

## How to get started

Merkl is a one-stop shop for finding the best investment opportunities in DeFi and it only takes a few clicks to get started!

1. Visit the [Merkl App](https://app.merkl.xyz/).
2. Explore the various opportunities and find the one that suits you best.
3. Before getting on any Merkl opportunity, make sure that you understand how it works and how users can be rewarded as part of this opportunity. For this, we encourage you to:

- look into [the page of the docs](../../mechanisms/types-of-campaign.md) that covers the campaign type in question. All campaign types have their specificity and it's crucial to understand them before trying to earn rewards from it
- look into the page associated with the opportunity. Every opportunity listed on Merkl has its dedicated page, and on each page you may find the details of the different campaigns that were created for the opportunity. It's important to look into the cards associated with the live campaigns so you understand whether [specific hooks](../../mechanisms/hooks/README.md) apply to them.
- understand the protocol where you're depositing liquidity and DYOR before putting funds somewhere. The main risk with Merkl lies with the underlying protocols being incentivized, not with Merkl, as you do not need to stake any assets to be eligible and claim your rewards. Your funds on underlying protocols could be at risk due to the inherent risks associated with those protocols, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or operational failures. While we do our best to whitelist every project we work with to ensure they are reliable and safe for our users, we cannot fully audit every project using the platform, and are not responsible for the potential issues of the protocols incentivized on Merkl.

4. Invest your liquidity directly on the protocol's app by following the provided links.
5. That's it! You're now earning rewards, no staking or other onchain action is needed.
6. You should normally be able to track your active positions and your rewards by visiting your [user dashboard](https://app.merkl.xyz/user/). Note that while the majority of protocols we support are accurately tracked, there may be some situations where the Merkl frontend is unable to detect your position in a given protocol. The source of truth in this case remains the frontend of the protocols where you deposited funds. It's not because your position is not detected on the user page of the Merkl frontend that you cannot be eligible to rewards for this position. Also, positions that lead to rewards received from airdrop campaigns will not be visible in the user dashboard.
7. Once you've earned rewards, you can claim all your earned tokens with a single click.

Happy farming!

Before aping in a campaign, do not get lured by APR values: it could be the case the only whitelisted addresses can access rewards, or that only highly concentrated positions earn the majority of what's available for rewards

## Rewards on Merkl

Rewards on Merkl do not increase block by block, but can be claimed at a frequency which depends on the chain. You can check the claim frequency at this [link](https://app.merkl.xyz/status).

Note that, by default, rewards can only be claimed by the address that earned them. If you need to claim rewards on behalf of another address, please [open a tech ticket in our Discord ](https://discord.com/channels/1209830388726243369/1210212731047776357)so that the team can whitelist your address.
